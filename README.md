# FotoCops-ELA
## This is the repository created for detecting fake images based on Error Level Analysis Algorithm (ELA) and thereafter trained using a CNN based architecture
##### Here the model is trained in Google Colab GPU and took around 3 hours time
##### Trained with Tensorflow==2.4.1 and Keras is imported from tensorflow ( so default version == 2.2.0)
##### Any lower tensorflow version will not be able to load the trained model and will shoot read error 
##### Python==3.8
